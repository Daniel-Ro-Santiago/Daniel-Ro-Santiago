## Hi there

I'm Daniel, an actuarial science student based in Mexico.

I'm interested in applying statistics, mathematics, and data science to develop better solutions for complex problems.

I develop projects in areas such as actuarial modeling, machine learning, financial analysis, computational biology, and software development. 

Sometimes I also program games, mobile apps, or ideas just for fun.

My main tech stack includes Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Shell, along with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and FastAI. My favorite tools and platforms are Hugging Face and Power BI.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but one of my favorites is [Dogecoin Time Series Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/Daniel-Ro-Santiago/Dogecoin-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting).

**Facts:**

- Currently exploring computer vision.
- Occasionally working on soccer match data analysis.
